# Description

Common submodule for some projects using **offscreen_effect_player**

# Sample structure

- **offscreen_effect_player** - is a wrapper for effect_player. It allows you to use your own implementation for offscreen_render_target
- **offscreen_render_target** - is an implementation option for the offscreen_render_target interface. Allows to prepare gl framebuffers and textures for receiving a frame from gpu, receive bytes of the processed frame from the gpu and pass them to the cpu, as well as, if necessary, set the orientation for the received frame. This implementation uses GLFW to work with gl context
- **libraries**
  - **renderer** - used only to demonstrate how to work with offscreen_effect_player. Draws received frames to the specified GLFW window
  - **utils**
    - **glfw_utils** - contains helper classes to work with GLFW
    - **ogl_utils** - contains helper classes to work with Open GL
    - **utils** - contains common helper classes such as thread_pool
- **interfaces** - offscreen effect player interfaces
- **preprocessor** - autogenerated project configuration files and some build macros

# Note

For integration of the Offscreen Effect player to your application it is necessary to copy the offscreen_effect_player folder and implement interfaces for offscreen_render_target, but if your application is based on the GLFW library, you can just reuse offscreen_render_target with the utility library.
